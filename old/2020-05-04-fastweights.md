In this post, we will study the applicability of design of experiments (DoE) in machine learning (ML) experiments, to do so we will use a machine learning paper as a case study. All the code necessary to reproduce this blog can be found on [here](https://github.com/jeffhernandez1995/fastweights).

## Motivation
Machine learning is a kind of a special science field, while sometimes unnecessary mathematical and theoretical and many times rightfully so, the majority of machine learning progress is driven by experiments, either by proposing new architectures, new optimizers, or new paradigms of training. As a mainly experimental field it is of extreme importance to carry out empirically rigorous experiments to support the claims that cannot be proven mathematically and to make sure that results cannot be explained by alternative hypotheses other than our own.

Recently, there have been concerns about the reproducibility or applicability of a significant proportion of published research. Some of these include the work of Henderson et. al. [\[7\]](#henderson2018deep) that concludes that recent advancements in deep reinforcement learning might not be significant due to problems in experimental design and evaluation. Likewise the work of Musgrave et. al. [\[8\]](#musgrave2020metric) which has cast doubt at advancements in metric learning caused by several flaws in experiment design, unfair comparisons, and testing set leakage. These are not isolated events as it is easy to find other examples in other sub-areas of ML [\[9](#lucic2018gans), [10\]](#melis2017state).

These problems are not unique to ML research, in fact fields such as psychology where lack of experimental rigor that have been going for years have eroded trust in the entire field [\[11\]](#open2015estimating). In ML, these trends are recent and have been identified by some scholars (shamefully taken from this excellent paper [\[6\]](#lipton2018troubling) from professor Zachary Lipton), these are:

1. Failure to distinguish between explanation and speculation.
2. Failure to identify the sources of empirical gains, e.g. emphasizing unnecessary modifications to neural architectures when gains actually stem from hyper-parameter tuning.
3. Mathiness: the use of mathematics that obfuscates or impresses rather than clarifies, e.g. by confusing technical and non-technical concepts.
4. Misuse of language, e.g. by choosing terms of art with colloquial connotations or by overloading established technical terms.

Int this post we only focus on trends 1 and 2.

## Disclaimer
The fact that these problems have been identified by people from within the community is itself a great step. Likewise many researchers have already started suggesting solution to these problems by proposing workflows for lab collaboration and reproducibility [\[12\]](#chen2019open), by proposing widespread use of statical tools like ablation studies  [\[6\]](#lipton2018troubling), significance testing and other statistical methods. In some sense, this blog post can be seen as a lightweight version of the work of Boquet et. al. [\[13\]](#boquet2019decovac) (if you have the time please read this paper), where they propose the use of design of experiments (DoE) which can help address the failure to identify the factors of empirical variation and failure to distinguish between explanation and speculation highlighted by [\[6\]](#lipton2018troubling). Unlike them, I only choose one paper [\[1\]](#ba2016using) to provide a concrete example, while I understand that the results of presented in this blog can be seen as an attack on the authors and I do stand by the claims made here, it is not my intention to in any way attack the authors of said paper. Finally, I try to end on the positive note, namely that this work has inspired more research [\[2](#zhang2017learning), [3](#schlag2018learning), [4\]](#le2020self) tipping the balance of knowledge in science in a positive way.

## Case Study (Using Fast Weights to Attend to the Recent Past [\[1\]](#ba2016using))

### What are _fast weights_?
Fast Weights are extend standard vanilla recurrent neural network architecture with an associative memory. In the context of this paper, the authors identify two types of memory in traditional recurrent neural networks, hidden activity vectors $\mathbf{h}_t$, that are updated every time-step, and serve as short-term memory and slow weights (traditional weights matrices) that are updated at the end of a batch and that have more memory capacity. The authors motivate a third type of memory called fast weights  that has much higher storage capacity than the neural activities but much faster dynamics than the standard slow weights [\[1\]](#ba2016using). (We note as the author did that these concepts were developed much early in [\[14\]](#hinton1987using) and [\[15\]](#schmidhuber1992learning))

The author also give biological motivations for the concept of fast weights, namely that human do not store exact patterns of neural activity as memory, instead memory retrieval involves reconstructing neural patterns through a set of associative weights which can map to many other memories as well.

| **Figure 1**:  The fast associative memory model. Extracted from [\[1\]](#ba2016using).|

Figure 1 shows a diagram of how fast weights affects hidden activity vector. After hidden activity $h_t$ is computed a brief iterative settling process (of size $S$) is started, during this process a fast weight matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is updated using a form of Hebbian short-term synaptic plasticity (outer product)

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \mathbf{A}_t = \lambda \mathbf{A}_{t-1} + \eta \mathbf{h}_t \mathbf{h}_t^\intercal,
    \end{aligned}
    \tag{1}\label{1}
\end{equation}

where $\lambda$ and $\eta$ are called decay rate and fast learning
rate respectively. $\mathbf{A}_t$ (assumed to be zero at the start of the sequence) maintains a dynamically changing short-term memory of the recent history of hidden activities in the network.

The next hidden activity is computed unrolling an _inner loop_ of size $S$ that progressively changes the hidden state (red path in Figure 1) using the input $x_t$ and the previous hidden vector. At each iteration of the inner loop, the fast weight matrix is exactly equivalent to attention mechanism between past hidden vectors and the current hidden vector, weighted by a decay factor [\[1\]](#ba2016using). The final equation for the model is

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \mathbf{h}_{t+1} = f\left(\mathcal{LN}\left[\mathbf{W}_h \mathbf{h}_{t} + \mathbf{W}_x \mathbf{x}_{t} + (\eta \sum_{\tau=1}^{\tau=t-1} \lambda^{t - \tau -1} f(\mathbf{W}_h \mathbf{h}_{t} +  \mathbf{W}_x \mathbf{x}_{t})\right]\right)
    \end{aligned}
    \tag{2}\label{2}
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{LN} \[.\]$ refers to layer normalization (LN).

### Main claim of the fast weights paper

Using four experiments the authors try to justify the advantages of fast weights over traditional recurrent architectures. These experiments are associative retrieval, MNIST classification using visual glimpses, Facial expression classification using visual glimpses and reinforcement learning. Result of these experiments seem to suggest that the incorporated fast weight matrix is the sole responsible for the observed superior performance. However, there are to factor of variation not accounted for in the paper by Ba et. al. [\[1\]](#ba2016using). I am not the first person to identity these factors in fact researcher Emin Orhan is the first to identify these problems in [\[5\]](#orhan2017note) (His blog is great, you should definitely check it out). These factors are:
1.  As proposed in equation $\eqref{2}$ the model has more depth than standard recurrent architectures. In [\[5\]](#orhan2017note) Orhan noted that as proposed this architecture is not biologically plausible and that there are ways to incorporate the fast weight matrix without increasing the effective depth. This is in fact how the original fast weights were proposed in [\[14\]](#hinton1987using).
2. Layer normalization has been shown to improve the performance of vanilla recurrent networks and no classical RNN with layer normalization  or fast weight without are tested in the paper, this implies that some of the improvement is due to LN.
3. Ba et. al. [\[1\]](#ba2016using) hypothesize that fast weights allows RNN's to use their recurrent units more effectively, allowing to reduce the hidden vector size without harming performance. To show this the authors compare with an LSTM, but the comparison should be carried out using standards RNN to see if the performance gains are not due to factors (1) and (2) or better initialization schemes, or the use of the optimizer.

### The role of Design of experiments (DoE)

Quoting the work of [\[13\]](#boquet2019decovac):

>We control almost completely the environment where the experiments are run and thus the data-generating process, we can define a specific **design** to reason about statistical reproducibility while comparing the results of different runs of different algorithms. 
>

This design is the result of having formulated three hypotheses about different factor that could explain the superior performance seen in [\[1\]](#ba2016using) rather than the fast weight matrix, We turn to Design of experiments (DoE) for a framework that will allows to test these hypotheses. More specifically we will perform a $2^k r$ factorial designs with replications where $k$ is the number of factor and $r$ the number of replications. In our simple case we will assume that our observations are i.i.d, we could estimate the effects of each experiment with the linear regression model with a binary explanatory variable

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}^\intercal \mathbf{q} + \mathbf{q_0} + \epsilon 
    \end{aligned}
    \tag{3}\label{3}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{y}$ is vector of responses, $\mathbf{X}$ is a binary matrix that encodes the factors and their iterations (linear, quadratic, cubic), $\mathbf{q}$ and $\mathbf{q_0}$ are called fixed effects and $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{I})$ is random noise. We the must perform experiments for all factor combinations (and interactions), namely $2^k$.

For our case study these factors are:
1. **DEPTH**: a binary variable that represent where we use $\eqref{2}$ which increases the overall depth of the network or the following:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \mathbf{h}_{t+1} = f\left(\mathcal{LN}\left[ \left(\mathbf{W}_h  + \eta \sum_{\tau=1}^{\tau=t-1} \lambda^{t - \tau -1} \mathbf{h}_{\tau} \mathbf{h}_{\tau}^\intercal \right) \mathbf{h}_{t} + \mathbf{W}_x \mathbf{x}_{t}\right]\right)
    \end{aligned}
    \tag{4}\label{4}
\end{equation}
which doesnât increase the effective depth and would be more biologically plausible.
2. **LN**: a binary variable for Layer normalization
3. **HS**: a binary variable that encodes the hidden size of the network (64, 128)
For control we perform two more experiment dubbed **CTRL** with no fast weights and no LN, only varying the hidden size.
