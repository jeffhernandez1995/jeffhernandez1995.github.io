John Schulman (Thinking Machines) on this [blog](https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/lora/) argues, backed by careful experiments, that **LoRA RL fine-tuning can match full-parameter RL fine-tuning**. His intuition comes from the fact that in common reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) settings the **total number of bits** fed to the learner is small, so you don’t need to move all base weights to absorb the signal. In particular, he writes:

|:--:| 
| **Figure 1**: The number of bits provided by SFT vs RL. Extracted from [\[1\]](#schulman2025lora).|

He also gives a concrete back-of-the-envelope: for the MATH dataset, roughly $$10{,}000$$ problems × $$32$$ samples implies **$$\lesssim 320{,}000$$ bits** if each completion yields ~1 bit. Meanwhile, even **rank-1 LoRA** on Llama-3.1-8B has $$\sim 3$$M parameters, **orders of magnitude** more than the training signal, so LoRA should be enough to absord this much information.

The claim sparked a lively debate on Twitter and other adjacent ML spaces. I’ll quote a few representative takes to set the stage:

**Prof. Ahmad Beirami** on this [twitter thread](https://x.com/abeirami/status/1974544870720385124) argues:

| ![Beirami]({{ '/pictures/prof_beirami.png' | relative_url }}) | 
|:--:| 
| **Figure 2**: Since the thread is super long i have summarized the main points as: RL with a **binary sequence-level reward** can reveal at most **$$O(1)$$** bits per *rollout* (≤ 1 bit in his toy setup), whereas a **positive SFT example** can carry **$$\log(1/\alpha)$$** bits when positives are rare (here $$\alpha$$ is the probability a random rollout would succeed).  The contrast is not $$O(1)$$ vs $$O(T)$$ implying that with sequence-level binary rewards, **$$T$$** doesn’t appear.|


**Rishabh Agarwal** raises the “surprise” angle [here](https://x.com/agarwl_/status/1973256746606195171):

| ![Agarwal]({{ '/pictures/agarwl.png' | relative_url }}) | 
|:--:| 
| **Figure 3**: One bit that confirms a *very* rare good solution (say 1 in a million) should cause a larger weight change than a bit confirming a common solution (1 in 10). *How* rare a good outcome is matters.|

**Susan Zhang** emphasizes design choices and that this is not a hard limitation on [here](https://x.com/suchenzang/status/1972752654226043027):

| ![Zhang]({{ '/pictures/suchenzang.png' | relative_url }}) | 
|:--:| 
| **Figure 4**: The “$$O(1)$$ bits per episode” is **not fundamental to RL**, it’s a property of **using only sequence-level binary rewards**. If we provide **intermediate or token-level rewards**, the information per episode can scale with $$T$$.|


**Dimitris Papailiopoulos and Aryaman Arora** discuss gradient dimensionality and have the following exchange [here](https://x.com/dpapaio/status/1974326222634866688):

| ![DimitrisandAryaman]({{ '/pictures/dimitris_aryaman.png' | relative_url }}) | 
|:--:| 
| **Figure 4**: Even if the reward is a single scalar, the **gradient** is a long vector (roughly $$O(T)$$ coordinates). Does that mean the *update* carries $$O(T)$$ information? Or does the scalar bottleneck cap the *task-relevant* information anyway?|


This posts uses a **toy “symbol-emitting bandit”** to try to formalize these points and then generalize some of the bounds. The math is simple and uses **data-processing** and **counting** arguments. The main takeaways are:

-   **Binary sequence-level RL**: each rollout update carries **≤ 1 bit**; **grouped $$K$$** rollouts carry at most **$$\log_2(K{+}1)$$** bits per prompt (often much less because many endings duplicate).
    
-   **SFT positives**: a single positive can carry **$$\log_2(1/\alpha)$$** bits, this value gets larger when successes are rare. If you create positives by **filtering** rollouts, the **per-rollout** info returns to $$O(1)$$.

-   **Dense/token-level rewards**: with this per-episode capacity can be **$$O(T)$$**. This is a **design choice**, not a fundamental limitation of RL (which reinforces Susan’s point).

-   **LoRA vs FullFT**: If total training signal across RL is $$B$$ bits, **small adapters** can fit it; you don’t need to move all base weights. Moreover, the **group-of-$$K$$** analysis shows bits grow **logarithmically** in $$K$$, making Schulman’s 1-bit-per-completion **conservative** in many cases.

I wrote  a small scripts to **empirically check** theese bounds. They’re simple “sanity plots,” not exhaustive experiments. You can find them [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hqcLfqvcgpg8C9L4oBVyTtKFpvRs4McX?usp=sharing)
    
Please note: I am kind of rusty on my information theory, and RL so if you spot mistakes please let me know!!

## A simple model: the “symbol-emitting bandit”

Think of a verifiable task (like many math/code problems) where we sample random symbols and the **final answer is a single symbol** all sampled from a vocabulary $$\mathcal V$$.

-   There is a random but **verifiable answer**: a random variable $$S\in\mathcal V$$ .
    
-   The policy $$\pi_\theta$$ samples a trajectory $$\tau=(x_{1:T})$$ and **emits the last token** $$x_T$$.
    
-   **Reward**: $$r(\tau,S)=\mathbf 1\{x_T=S\}\in\{0,1\}$$ (binary, sequence-level).
    

We make the following **on-policy assumption.** In a single update step, $$\tau \perp\!\!\!\perp S \mid \theta$$: the rollout is drawn from the current policy and is independent of the true answer.

**Policy-gradient update (REINFORCE form).** For one rollout, an unbiased update looks like

$$
\hat g = (r-b)\,\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(\tau),
$$

for some baseline $$b$$ (possibly computed from a batch). For a group of $$K$$ rollouts, $$\hat g$$ is a function of $$\{(\tau_i,r_i)\}_{i=1}^K$$.

We’ll ask the question: **how many bits about $$S$$** can $$\hat g$$ carry?

## The proofs

### Binary, sequence-level rewards give at most one bit per rollout

**Lemma (One-bit bound).**  
If $$r=f(S,\tau)\in\{0,1\}$$ is binary and $$g=\Phi(\tau,r)$$ is any update based on $$(\tau,r)$$, then

$$
I(g;S) \;\le\; I((\tau,r);S) \;=\; I(S;r\mid \tau) \;\le\; H(r\mid \tau) \;\le\; 1.
$$

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click to see proof</strong></summary>

Data processing gives \(I(g;S)\le I((\tau,r);S)\) because \(g\) is a function of \((\tau,r)\). Since \(\tau\perp\!\!\!\perp S\) we have \(I((\tau,r);S)=I(S;r\mid \tau)\). Finally \(I(S;r\mid\tau)\le H(r\mid\tau)\le 1\) because \(r\) is binary. \(\square\)

</details>

For the case of *continuous rewards.* One would repeat the analysis after a $$b$$\-bit quantization $$Q(r)$$, yielding $$I(g;S)\le H(Q(r)\mid \tau)\le b$$.

**Corollary (symbol-bandit).** Let the last token be $$T$$ and $$r=\mathbf{1}\{T=S\}$$ with $$S$$ uniform over a vocabulary $$\mathcal V$$ of size $$V$$. Then

$$
I(g;S)\le I((T,r);S)=H(r\mid T)=h(1/V)\le 1,
$$

with $$h(\cdot)$$ being the binary entropy.


| ![proof1]({{ '/pictures/fig_single_mi_vs_V.png' | relative_url }}) | 
|:--:| 
| **Figure 5**: We simulate a uniform policy and measure $$I(S;(T,r))$$. Theory says $$I=H(r\!\mid\!T)=h(1/V)\le 1$$. We can see that this simple model matches $$h(1/V)$$ closely; always $$\le 1$$ bit.|

### $$K$$ rollouts (GRPO/RLOO) and a $$\log(M{+}1)$$ bound

For a prompt, draw $$K$$ rollouts $$(\tau_i)_{i=1}^K$$ with binary rewards $$r_i=f(S,\tau_i)$$. Let $$M$$ be the number of **distinct final tokens** among the $$\tau_i$$. Denote $$\mathbf r=(r_1,\dots,r_K)$$.

**Theorem (Group bound).**  
For any update $$g=\Phi(\{\tau_i,r_i\}_{i=1}^K)$$,

$$
I(g;S) \;\le\; I(\{(\tau_i,r_i)\}_{i=1}^K;S) \;=\; H(\mathbf r \mid \{\tau_i\}) \;\le\; \log_2\!\bigl(M{+}1\bigr),
$$

and in particular $$\mathbb E[I(g;S)] \le \mathbb E[\log_2(M{+}1)] \le \log_2(K{+}1)$$.

<details>

By data processing, \(I(g;S)\le I(\{(\tau_i,r_i)\};S)\). Using \(\{\tau_i\}\perp\!\!\!\perp S\) and determinism of \(\mathbf r\) given \((S,\{\tau_i\})\), we have  
\(I(\{(\tau_i,r_i)\};S)=I(S;\mathbf r\mid\{\tau_i\})=H(\mathbf r\mid\{\tau_i\})\).  
Fix \(\{\tau_i\}\). As \(S\) ranges over the vocabulary, \(\mathbf r\) can realize at most \(M\) patterns with ones at positions that share the same final token, plus the all-zero pattern when \(S\) is none of the distinct tokens. Hence at most \(M{+}1\) patterns; entropy is maximized by the uniform distribution, so \(H(\mathbf r\mid\{\tau_i\})\le\log_2(M{+}1)\). Taking expectations and using Jensen yields the stated bounds. \(\square\)

</details>

**Exact MI under a uniform prior.**  
If $$S$$ is uniform over $$V$$ symbols and we only care about the final tokens $$T_i$$, then conditionally on $$\{T_i\}$$ the distribution of $$\mathbf r$$ assigns probability $$1/V$$ to each of the $$M$$ “one-hot” patterns and $$(V{-}M)/V$$ to the all-zero pattern, giving

$$
I(\{(\tau_i,r_i)\};S)=H(\mathbf r\mid \{T_i\})= \log_2 V - \frac{V-M}{V}\log_2(V - M)\;\le\;\log_2(M{+}1).
$$

For this simulation, we sample $$K$$ last tokens for each prompt, count $$M$$ uniques, and compute the exact MI under uniform $$S$$:

$$
I = \log_2 V - \frac{V-M}{V}\log_2(V-M).
$$

We compare to the **average** $$\log_2(M{+}1)$$ and the loose $$\log_2(K{+}1)$$ bound.

| ![proof2]({{ '/pictures/fig_group_mi_vs_K.png' | relative_url }}) |
|:--:|
| **Figure 6**: The **true MI** (given final tokens) is **far below** $$\log_2(K{+}1)$$ when $$V\gg K$$. Duplicates keep $$M$$ small, so the practical bits per prompt are tiny.|

### Information from SFT (positive-only)

Let $$\tau^+$$ be a positive example consistent with $$S$$, drawn so that $$\Pr(\tau^+\text{ occurs})=\alpha$$ under the current sampler.

**Theorem (Positive-only SFT).**  
$$I(\tau^+;S)=H(S)-H(S\mid \tau^+)=\log_2(1/\alpha)$$ when the example reveals one element of a uniformly distributed good set with prior mass $$\alpha$$.

This highlights the 'cost' of the SFT example. If an expert gives you a positive example 'for free,' you get $$\log_2(1/\alpha)$$ bits. If you have to find that positive example by sampling $$\approx 1/\alpha$$ rollouts, the total information gained per rollout sampled is still bounded by $$O(1)$$, just like in the RL case.

<details> <summary><strong>Click to see proof</strong></summary>

Let \(\Omega\) be finite with \(|\Omega|=M\). For each solution \(S\), let \(A(S)\subseteq \Omega\) denote the positive set with \(|A(S)|=\alpha M\). By construction, \(\tau^+\mid S \sim \mathrm{Unif}(A(S))\), so

\(
H(\tau^+\mid S) = \mathbb{E}_{S}\big[\log_2 |A(S)|\big] = \log_2(\alpha M).
\)

Assume the \(\alpha\)-symmetry condition that makes the marginal of \(\tau^+\) uniform on \(\Omega\), hence

\(
H(\tau^+) = \log_2 M.
\)

Therefore,

\(
I(\tau^+;S) = H(\tau^+) - H(\tau^+\mid S) = \log_2 M - \log_2(\alpha M) = \log_2(1/\alpha).
\)
\(\square \)

### When (and why) you can get $$O(T)$$

Let token-level feedback be $$R_{1:T}=(R_1,\dots,R_T)$$ with alphabets $$\mathcal A_t$$ (sizes $$A_t$$). The update $$g$$ is a function of $$(\tau,R_{1:T})$$.

**Theorem (Token-level capacity).**  
With $$\tau\perp\!\!\!\perp S$$,

$$
I(g;S)\;\le\; I((\tau,R_{1:T});S) \;=\; I(S;R_{1:T}\mid \tau) \;\le\; H(R_{1:T}\mid \tau)\;\le\;\sum_{t=1}^T \log_2 A_t.
$$

In particular, when each $$R_t$$ is binary, $$I(g;S)\le T$$ bits.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click to see proof</strong></summary>

Data processing and conditional independence give $$I(g;S)\le I((\tau,R_{1:T});S)=I(S;R_{1:T}\mid \tau)$$. Entropy subadditivity yields $$H(R_{1:T}\mid \tau)\le \sum_t H(R_t\mid \tau)\le \sum_t \log_2 A_t$$. \(\square\)

</details>

**Tightness for binary tokens.**  
Let each target token $$s_t\in\{0,1\}$$ be i.i.d. fair, the policy emits $$x_t\in\{0,1\}$$, and define $$R_t=\mathbf 1\{x_t=s_t\}$$. Then $$s_t = x_t \oplus (1-R_t)$$, so $$S$$ is deterministically recoverable from $$(\tau,R_{1:T})$$ and $$I((\tau,R_{1:T});S)=H(S)=T$$ bits. Thus the bound is **tight**.

We simulate a toy token-level signal $$R_t=\mathbf 1\{x_t=s_t\}$$ with fair binary tokens. Theory predicts **exactly $$T$$ bits**.

| ![proof3]({{ '/pictures/fig_token_level_mi_vs_T.png' | relative_url }}) |
|:--:|
| **Figure 7**: As expected: **linear** growth in bits with $$T$$ when **per-token** information is present.|

**Which RL algorithms use token-level signals?** PPO/A2C with per-token advantages, token-level actor-critic/Q-learning, etc. Distributional RL helps with return shapes but is not required for $$O(T)$$; **the key is giving informative per-step rewards**.

---

### Putting it together: what does this mean in practice?

-   In **binary, sequence-level RL** (many verifiable math setups), the **information channel is narrow**: ≤ 1 bit per rollout, ≤ $$\log_2(K{+}1)$$ bits per grouped prompt.  **LoRA** (even low rank) often suffices to absorb the signal; **variance reduction** and **exploration** matter more than raw capacity.
    
-   In **SFT**, a positive example can deliver **$$\log_2(1/\alpha)$$** bits when good outcomes are rare. If your positives are mined from on-policy rollouts, the **per-rollout** bits are $$O(1)$$ again.

-   If you want **more bits per episode**, **change the supervision channel**: add **token-level** checks, **intermediate verifications**, **graded/real rewards**, or structured signals (e.g., constraint satisfaction at multiple steps). With such designs, **$$O(T)$$** bits-per-episode is possible, and algorithm families that **consume per-step rewards** (per-token PPO/A2C/actor-critic/Q-learning) can use them.

## FAQs

**“But the gradient is $$O(T)$$\-dimensional!”**  
Yes, but **data-processing** arguments pin down *task-relevant information*. Given $$\theta$$, the only $$S$$\-dependent random variable in a sequence-level binary RL update is **the scalar reward** (possibly centered). Multiplying a scalar by a long vector **does not create new bits** about $$S$$. Think of the gradient $$\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(\tau)$$ as a very long, complex lever. The reward $$r$$ is the tiny force (1 bit) you apply to that lever. The lever's shape determines which of the billions of weights move (the $$O(T)$$ dimensionality), but the total amount of task-relevant information driving the push is still just that 1 bit.

**“Does GRPO/RLOO add information?”**  
They **reduce variance** using group statistics but **do not increase** the per-prompt bits in the binary case beyond the **$$\log_2(M{+}1)$$** counting argument. With **graded** rewards the supervision gets richer and the bound scales accordingly.

**“What about exploration and KL?”**  
Better exploration **increases the rate** at which useful events happen (wall-clock efficiency) but does not change the **per-rollout** information bound unless you **expand the feedback**. KL regularization shapes optimization but **doesn’t inject new information** about $$S$$.
