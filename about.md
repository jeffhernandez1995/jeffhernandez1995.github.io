### About Me
I am a second year computer science PhD student at [Vislang Lab](https://www.vislang.ai) in [Rice University](https://cs.rice.edu/), advised by [Prof. Vicente Ordonez](http://vicenteordonez.com). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering from [ESPOL](http://www.espol.edu.ec/) (top 1% of the class), where I worked with [Prof. Andres G. Abad](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andres-Abad-2) on machine learning and computer vision. I also worked as a research assistant at [INARI Lab](https://inarilab.com/) on applications of computer vision to retail. I have also shortly worked as a Computer Vision engineer at [adaviv](https://www.adaviv.com/).

I am interested in computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning. I am particularly interested in self-supervised learning for video data.
I am currently working on multimodal learning for to solve vairous vision tasks using language.

As a PhD student, I am always eager to collaborate with other researchers. If you are interested in working with me, feel free to reach out to me via email.
